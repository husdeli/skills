# Changelog

All notable changes to the **clean-architecture** plugin are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Deterministic `orchestrate-core` workflow (`workflows/orchestrate-core.js`): a
  code-controlled plan → gated review → single revision → implement → verify (with a
  fix-and-recheck loop) pipeline that returns a structured `completed`/`escalate`/`aborted`
  result.

### Changed
- `/orchestrate` is now a **hybrid**: the interactive shell (task selection, approval, and
  the interview decisions) runs in the main loop, then hands the mechanical core off to the
  `orchestrate-core` workflow. The review skip gate and the verify/fix loop are now
  deterministic code rather than model judgment.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- `feature-interviewer` agent and an interview/challenge stage before planning, so
  non-trivial features settle their open decisions with the user before a plan is written.
- `/orchestrate` command: picks the next actionable roadmap task and drives it through
  interview → plan → review → implement.
- `react-clean` skill: rules for clean React components (one component per file, at most one
  `useEffect`, no data-layer access from components).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- Initial packaging as a Claude Code plugin.
- `clean-fullstack-architecture` skill with hexagonal dependency rules.
- `ai-planning-workflow` skill.
- `implementation-planner`, `plan-reviewer`, and `coding` agents.
